## Research

Quantum computing\

[I began my research career by analyzing models of confined quantum wells, where I developed a foundation in quantum mechanics and computational techniques. I've shifted my focus to quantum computing with dedication of quantum error correction and simulating quantum circuits. I'm commited to contribute to my team's efforts in advancing quantum software and developing reliable, efficient quantum systems ]{.small}
